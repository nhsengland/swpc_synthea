# Generating a patient dataset with personalised configuration

## Set up swpc_synthea
See [Readme](https://github.com/nhsengland/swpc_synthea/blob/master/README.md).

## Creating a patient dataset
See the original Synthea documentation that can be found [here](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Basic-Setup-and-Running).

### Synthea Properties
The `src/main/resources/synthea.properties` file controls the main configuration of the simulation

Here is a reduced view of the file for the main configuration options used in swpc_synthea and their default values

generate.log_patients.detail = simple
# options are "none", "simple", or "detailed" (without quotes). defaults to simple if another value is used
# none = print nothing to the console during generation
# simple = print patient names once they are generated.
# detailed = print patient names, attributes, vital signs, etc..  May slow down processing
